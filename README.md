Data Science Project
==============================

This is a template for your final data science project. It offers a structure for your project, but does not have to be followed strictly. In case your project has different needs, feel free to adapt it.

Data Sources
------------

A list of potential datasets to use can be found [here](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets). You can also suggest your own dataset, but it needs to be approved.

Before you start working on your project, your research question and hypotheses need to approved first.

Requirements
------------

The README.md needs to contain the instructions to download all data and reproduce your experiments. All analyses and results need to be reproducible and documented in notebooks. In a sense, the notebooks should act as a final report, both containing your hypotheses, methods, experiments, visualizations, analyses, plus results and also explanining these. They should be understandable to a third party, who has not worked on the project.

Your data science project must contain the following elements:

- A clearly stated problem definition as well as three hypotheses that you want to test.
- At least one model that you have trained and evaluated.
- At least one statistical significance test.
- At least one visualization.

Grading
------------

To pass, your project must be fully reproducible without errors. To ensure reproducibilty, you can run the project in a fresh environment and follow the instructions you provide in this README.md.

Otherwise, your project will be graded based on:

1. The quality of the documentation and code.
   - Are all steps documented?
   - Is the code understandable? (Add comments and references where necessary)
2. Understandibility of the experiments and results. For example:
   - Why did you opt for a particular method?
   - What does a particular visualization show?
   - What do your results mean?

In particular, we will not be grading based on the results of your experiments. You can get full points, as long as you can explain why you did what you did. We will not penalize you if your results are not statistically significant or you applied an incorrect method or test. On the other hand, applying correct methods will certainly not hurt your grade ;)
